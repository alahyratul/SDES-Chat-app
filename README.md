# SDES Chatting Algorithm


This is basic feature demonstration of a chatting app that use _**SDES encryption algorithm**_. 
SDES algorithm is faster then conventional encryption technique and safer because it generates dynamic encryption key. Key feature of this algorith:
* Registering a user with a central authority;
* Securely transmitting an initial dynamic authentication key to the user;
* Synchronizing a dynamic authentication key generation process at the central authority and the user;

The algorithm was developed by **Dr. Hamdy Soliman, Professor, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology**.
